# THRESHOLD-DETECTION
This repository contains the codes to implement the threshold estimators under a semiparametric regression model
To execute the examples you need the file funciones-estimacion.R that contains the function to compute the estimators.

The analysis of the LIDAR data set is contained in the file LIDAR-ANALYSIS.R

The analysis of the air quality data set is contained in the file OZONE-ANALYSIS.R

Examples of the simulation runs are included in the files simulation_4_examples.R and funciones_bxp.R The last one computes the threshodl estimators as well as the intercept and slope estimators and gives paralel boxplots of them.
